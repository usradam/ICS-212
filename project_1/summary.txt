My testing for each case went perfectly fine, just as I had expected based on my test plan. I was able to test the conditionals of my database functions and made sure that I could handle the possible test cases that a user may input. That is, all functions in the program were tested under certain scenarios, most importantly for adding a record, finding a record, and deleting a record. There were also test cases for erroneous user inputs such as the number 0, a string, a number combined with a string, and a negative number. As stated, all planned testing showed that these cases could be handled correctly. I was also able to make sure that the necessary record(s) from the database were saved to a file once the program quit. I do not have any recommendations as to the aesthetics of the user interface since I think the printed info is clear and concise for the user. I also did not encounter any bugs that would cause the program to behave unexpectedly. In general, the program succeeded in its purpose.
