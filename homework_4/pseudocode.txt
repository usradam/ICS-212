addRecord

*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

define a pointer to record called current
define a pointer to record called previous
define a pointer to record called new_record
define an int called return_val

copy from 0 to return_val
copy from start to current
copy from NULL to previous

while (current is not equal to NULL and accountno in the record whose address is in current is less than uaccountno)
    copy from current to previous
    copy from next of the record whose address is in current to current

if (current is not equal to NULL and accountno in the record whose address is in current is equal to uaccountno)
    copy from -1 to return_val

else
    allocate a heap space and store its address into new_record
    copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in new_record
    copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in new_record
    copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in new_record

    if (previous is equal to NULL)
        copy from start to next of the record whose address is in new_record
        copy from new_record to start
    else
        copy from next of the record whose address is in previous to next of the record whose address is in new_record
        copy from new_record to next of the record whose address is in previous
